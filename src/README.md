The src directory is typically used for storing the source code files of a project. This includes internal modules, private headers, and extensive source files. These files are the heart of your application and where most of your development time will be spent.

Internal modules are parts of your application that are not exposed to the outside world. They are used to organize your code and make it more manageable.

Private headers are header files that are not meant to be included by other source files outside of the src directory. They typically contain declarations for internal functions and variables.
